Note to reviewers:

The purpose of this document is to be a Quick Start guide to Adaptive Payments.
It's meant to be concise and to the point.

I am fully open to suggestions on how to improve this document, but at the same time, I would like to avoid unnecesary information bloating.
I'm aware that there is a lot of information regarding Adaptive Payments that is not mentioned in this guide, but put yourselves in the shoes of a developer that's never worked with PayPal before, and is now tasked with doing an AP integration.
I don't want to present a mountain of new information, as this will only raise the perceived learning curve ("I have to learn all that!?"). This guide is a gentle introduction to the world of PayPal API's and should not be an all-inclusive encyclopedia.
If you think that there is something absolutely essential that is missing, I will gladly add it to the document. If it's not critical, It will probably be added to the "Further Reading" appendix.

Any editorial suggestions on how to make the text more readable, typos, and logic errors are more than welcome.

Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedules to review this.
